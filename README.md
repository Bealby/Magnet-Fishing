# Jack Fairfield

---

The aim of this Website is to provide an insight into the life of my Papa,
Jack Fairfield, during his time in the second world war. During the war
Jack Fairfield wrote an extensive journal while serving
under the Royal Army Ordnance Corp.

This Website is a taster, aiming to entice curiosity into Jack Fairfield's
journey through the second world war, increasing users desire to learn more
from his journal.

The Website will mainly be for family and friends who have been very keen
to learn more about Jack Fairfield's life. As the Website expands however,
this interest could be expanded to Military Musuems and the general public,
including the musuem in his home town of Methilhil, Fife, Scotland.

## UX

---

Family and friends will seek to learn more about Jack Fairfield,
through imagery, passages from the journal and exploring his journeys
around the UK during the Second World War.

### Strategy

The main focus of this Website is to give family and friends
an insight into Jack Fairfield's life. It aims to
bring to life Jack Fairfield's journal with
the use of an interactive map; along with private
photos, passages and areas he visited
and resided in.

The Website needs to be suitable for mobile devices,
suiting users who want to browse the Website while on
the move. The desktop and tablet versions however
will provide a more visual and expansive user experience.

#### User Stories

- "We would love there to be lots of photos of Jack during the war.
    The more the merrier!"

- "The site must be easy to use and not too complicated. We would like
    to share Jack's life with others, especially Jack's older relatives and
    friends who are not very computer savvy."

- "It would be good to incorporate some of Jack's journal in the Website.
    Any fun anecdotes or snippets, giving examples of what he wrote"

- "It would be very interesting to learn more about Jack's personality and
    how he progressed in his Army career.

### Scope

To meet the goals of the users the Website needs to be
intuitive and easy to use, taking heed of the less
technically savvy audience.

A collection of photos that embrace and capture Jack
Fairfield's life will be essential to draw
and retain users interest, to achieve the desire to learn more.

The interactive Map will highlight the most frequented locations
in Jack Fairfield's journey through the Second World War. A passage
from his journal will be included along with a relevant photo.

### Structure

The Website's front page will be the window into the Website
with a hero-image centered on the page. His name and date of
duration of life will be displayed under the image, with a
clickable link, `Read More`, taking you into the main Website.

The naviagtion bar will have a `sticky-position` with the
links `Home`, `Bio`, and `Maps`.

The Home page will have a large photo that stretches the page,
rotating every 6 seconds with a new photo.

The Bio page will summarise Jack Fairfield's life and history
during the Second World War.

The Map page will be interactive and show locations
using Google Maps API. Each clickable location will bring up a pop
up window with a passage from Jack Fairfield's journal
along with a complementary photo.

### Surface

The Website will have a military colour theme with the main colour cenetered
around a light khaki colour, `rgb(209, 200, 171, 1)`, with white
borders, `rgb(255, 255, 255, 1)`, used to divide sections, photos and the Map.
The text will be of a black colour, `rgb(0,0,0,1)`, which contrasts well with the
khaki theme for clarity of font.

To distinguish between the sections a light green military colour will be
used, `rgb(190, 210, 195, 1)`, which merges with the Map colours, along
with a subtle white border that ensures the Map stands out.

The `hover` colour used for the links will be of a light grey colour,
`rgb(116,111,120,1)`, that helps inform users that the links are clickable.

For carousel images, captions will have a white colour font to ensure
clarity of reading.

The main font used for this Website will be `'Special Elite`, from `Google Fonts`.
A fitting type font with a military feel to it.
