            <p>Magnet Fishing is a niche, but growing sport, which involves 'casting' magnets into Canels,
               Lakes; and off Bridges and Piers; in the hope to connect to any metal artefacts. Artefacts that
               can range from Old Nails and Beer Bottle Tops; to Jewel and even a Scooter!</p>

            </p>Magnet Fishing is an easy sport to take up. All you need is a strong magnet and rope and you’re
                ready to go! Such items can be purchased online, such as at <a href="https://www.first4magnets.com" target="_blank">First 4 Magnets</a>, which
                provide international shipping.</p>

            <p class="home-quote">”Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things you didn’t do than by the 
                ones you did do. So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade
                winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. Discover.”… Mark Twain</p>
